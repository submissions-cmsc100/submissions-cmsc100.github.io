		<h1>HELLO!</h1>
		<p>As part of my submission for the first lab exercise in CMSC100, I will introduce myself below.</p>
		
		<h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
		<p>My name is <b>Mirella Arguelles</b> but most people call me <b>Mira</b>.</p>
		<h2>WHAT DO I LIKE?</h2>
		<p>
		My favorite CMSC subject is <b>CMSC 123</b> where we learned fundamental data structures.<br> Here, we were
		introduced to time complexity measured in big O notation, graphs, binary search trees, and hash tables.
		It was plenty of fun implementing them on the exercises and I hope to learn more in CMSC 142 where there will
		be a more in-depth discussion on these topics.
		</p>
		<p>
		This semester, I am taking <b>SOSC 3</b>. <br> Despite the short amount of time given to compare, I could definitely
		say that this is my favorite GE subject so far. The modules are interesting to read and a lot of our misconceptions
		on its topics have been cleared out. I recommend this elective to everyone.
		</p>
		<p>
		My favorite programming language is <b>Python</b>. I don't have a proper reason why, I just like using it. :)
		</p>
		<p>
		My favorite food is <b>bread</b>. Bread is soft and cheap. Bread can be sweet or savory. <b>Bread is king.</b>
